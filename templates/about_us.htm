By integrating clothes, hairstyle pictures and style data from online shopping websites, we will build a simulation system that allows users to virtually experience the feeling of wearing different clothes and hairstyles.<br/><br/>What we want to do?<br/><br/> First, we will collect pictures and style data from online shopping websites, and use deep learning to create style indexes for various clothes and outfits to ensure that the system can fully understand the characteristics of different products and styles.   Second, we will develop an advanced dressing and hairstyle simulation system. By establishing skeleton models of clothing and users, we can adjust the details of the clothing to simulate wearing the clothing on the user. The system will allow users to virtually experience the effects of wearing different clothing and hairstyles, thereby providing a more specific reference for selection.   Third, we will use machine learning technology to develop intelligent models based on the user's personal preferences and style characteristics, which can generate personalized fashion recommendations that are in line with the user's aesthetics.   Finally, we will contact relevant suppliers to establish an alliance marketing model, and provide users with convenient purchase links by recommending accessories in their outfits, while also achieving the commercial feasibility of the project.<br/><br/> We wish you have a pleasant and enjoyable experience !<br/><br/> Our development team ---<br/><br/> GUO, JIN-HE<br/><br/> HUANG, YONG-FU<br/><br/> TSAI, CHENG-SHI<br/><br/> JIANG, JIE-YING  <br/> WANG, YU-TONG<br/><br/> --- 2023 . 11 . 26</div>
